# Problem Statement
---
This project aims to analyze the influence of corn and soybeans, America's most farmed corps, on key economic indicators in rural U.S. areas for approximately 15 years. By examining crop-related production and sales metrics this analysis seeks to identify correlations between crop production trends and rural economic development. We will investigate whether corn and soybean production data can be used to forecast changes in rural employment, income, and poverty levels. The goal is to assess the long-term economic impacts of crop productivity and sales on rural communities and to explore the predictive potential of corn data for future economic outcomes like employment, personal_income, and poverty levels.
